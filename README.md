# Vegetation Classifier
The Final Project of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp With Saudi Digital Academy and Le Wagon.

## Overview :
Building a model that predicts the Cover type of vegetation of trees in large forests to facilitate their study by environmental researchers and to know the best ways to protect them from fires and other hazards based on several features.

## Dataset : 
You can view our dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)
Unfortunately our dataset is Encoded, but don't worry, you will find the solution in Our Package Code :)

## Methodology :
1. Data UnEncoding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Train/Val/Test Method
5. Model Selection
6. Model Trainig
7. Model Evaluation
8. Model Deployment
9. Create a Project Package
10. Create a Streamlit Page

## Our Model and Results :
We Developed RandomForestClassifier Model from scikit-learn, with high Accuracy of 95%, and Recall of 95%
This means that our model makes 19 correct predictions out of 20.

Unfortunately you won't find the Model in this repository because the size of our model is 1536MB, but again, we're with you ;) So no need to worry.
All you have to do is download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1CKaFYKKV13CT44DqQqd-3g5oGKMfTu3p), then put it in a folder called models in parallel with the vegetation folder
